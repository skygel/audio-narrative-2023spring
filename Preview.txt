When working on my preview I focused on creating what I think will be the introduction of my sound scape. For my sound space I am showing a morning in the life of a college student through audio. Every morning when I wake up I set an alarm on my phone the night before to wake me up. For my audio clip preview I started with looking for audio clips online that sounded similar to my alarm I wake up to. I wanted to find a sound that wasnâ€™t too harsh on the ears when listening to it. I ended up finding the sound that I used on freesound.org. After looking through multiple pages of sounds I settled on one. I also wanted to try and find an audio clip of someone turning an alarm off. I thought that it would be difficult to find such a specific sound, but after searching freesound.org I was able to find the perfect audio of someone turning an alarm off. Every morning when I wake up I hear birds outside my window, certain mornings they can be very loud. I thought that it would be interesting to play with layering the sound of birds outside with the sound of the alarm in the morning. Once again, I searched freesound.org for different audio clips of birds chirping. After some searching, I was able to find 3 different clips of birds that I thought would work well and sound realistic. After downloading all of my clips I started layering them in Audacity. I started with the faint sound of birds chirping and then the sound of the alarm entering soon after. I then inserted the audio of the alarm turning off directly after. Throughout both of those audios I have the faint sound of birds chirping, then at the end I layered another audio clip of birds chirping louder.
